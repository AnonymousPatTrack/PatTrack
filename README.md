# PatTrack: Dynamic Real-time Learning with Gaussian Processes for Time-evolving Sequences
## Introduction
This project is the Matlab implementation of PatTrack, which is a realtime modeling method based on Gaussian processes to learn and forecast time series with pattern changes.
## Requirements
* Matlab R2019b or above
## Datasets
Four public datasets used in this project are included in:
* ./Datasets
## Quick demo
Please run run_demo.m in ./Demo to get started.
